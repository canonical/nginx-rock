[Rocks](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) for [Nginx](https://nginx.com/).  
This repository holds all the necessary files to build rocks for the upstream versions we support. The Nginx rock is used by the Observability HA charms (Loki, Mimir and Tempo).

The rocks on this repository are built with [OCI Factory](https://github.com/canonical/oci-factory/), which also takes care of periodically rebuilding the images.

**How do I interact with this repo?** This repo uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) to easily run some commands:
```
âˆ® just
Available recipes:
    clean version               # `rockcraft clean` for a specific version
    pack version=latest_version # Pack a rock of a specific version
    run version=latest_version  # Run a rock and open a shell into it with `kgoss`
    test version=latest_version # Test the rock with `kgoss`
```

Automation takes care of:
* validating PRs, by simply trying to build the rock;
* pulling upstream releases, creating a PR with the necessary files to be manually reviewed;
* on PRs, validate the added (or modified) rocks by running `kgoss`;
* releasing to GHCR at [ghcr.io/canonical/nginx:dev](https://ghcr.io/canonical/nginx:dev), when merging to main, for development purposes.
